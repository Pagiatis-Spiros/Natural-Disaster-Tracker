- **Click** on the marker at your preferred location and a box with its details should pop up on the right as shown in the screenshot.

## Download whole data as a CSV file.

- **Click** on the download icon in the header and a CSV files with all the data will be downloaded. (Preferably open in Excel for neat formatting)
